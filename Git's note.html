<br><em><b>git add</b></em>
<p>
    This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit. It typically adds the current content of
    existing paths as a whole, but with some options it can also be used to add content with only part of the changes made to the working tree files applied, or remove paths that do
    not exist in the working tree anymore

<em><b>git commit</b></em><br>
<p>
    In the first and second form, copy entries from <tree-ish> to the index. In the third form, set the current branch head (HEAD) to <commit>, optionally modifying index and working tree to match. The <tree-ish>/<commit> defaults to HEAD in all forms.
